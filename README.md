## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We all know that people head to the pharmacy to pick up antihistamines during the spring, but are there also months or seasons that affect other medicated illnesses? The main interests that will be explored include: which medications are most frequently distributed during certain months of the year and if the seasons affect medication distribution. Previously having worked at a pharmacy, I was always curious if exterior factors (that we couldn't control, like the weather) would affect those taking prescription medication, and if so, why? Given the extensive range of this data set, it will be quite recognizable if there is a trend over the course of the seasons.

An additional inquiry includes observing which days most people pick up their medications: early in the week on Monday, or after work on Friday?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data set contains 8 categories of various medications that are grouped based on their physiological working manner. The 8 categories are as follows:

Group1: anti-inflammatories, antirheumatic products, non-steriods, acetic acid derivatives and related products

Group2: anti-inflammatories, antirheumatic products, non-steriods, propionic acid derivatives and related products

Group3: Other analgesics and antipyretics, salicylic acid and derivatives

Group4: Other analgesics and antipyretics, pyrazolones and anilides

Group5: Psycholeptics drugs, anxiolytic drugs

Group6: Psycholeptics drugs, hypnotics and sedatives drugs

Group7: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases

Group8: Antihistamines for systemic use

The data was collected using a point of sale machine and recorded over the course of 6 years. Trends found in the data can most likely be considered authentic given that the data was collected over an extensive range.
