## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Space is a truly terrifying yet intriging aspect of science. One of the many interesting things about it is its interaction with the earth through meteorites. Over time, meteors have been proven useful in helping in the analysis of both our solar system and Earth's histories. Using this dataset, it is hoped to determined the regions of the earth that are most affected by meteorites landing on the surface of our planet. The main questions that will be explored are: what is the most commonly found material in these fallen meteors, is there any differences over time in the mass of meteorites that have fallen to Earth?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data was collected by The Meteoritical Society and further refined by NASA. The dataset cotains information pertaining to the year, location, mass and classification of the meteorites. Data collected was done so over the course of many years; the specific timeframe that will be analyzed will be over the past 200 years. The masses recorded vary significantly, and in order to make an coherent analysis from the data, only the meteors with a mass greater than 10,000g (10kg) were taken into consideration.

Amreesa: I'm curious to see if there's any trend within this aspect of the Earth's interaction with rogue extraterrestrial objects.
