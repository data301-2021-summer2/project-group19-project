## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Space is a truly terrifying yet intriging aspect of science. One of the many interesting things about it is its interaction with the earth through meteorites. Using this data set, it is hoped to determined the regions of the earth that are most affected by meteorites landing on the surface of our planet. The main questions that will be explored are: is there any  differences over time in the class of meteorites that have fallen to Earth (in terms of mass), and what is the most commonly found material in these fallen meteors?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data was collected by The Meteoritical Society and further refined by NASA. The dataset cotains information pertaining to the year, location, mass and classification of the meteorites. Data collected was done so over the course of many years; the specific timeframe that will be analyzed will be described further in milestone 2.
